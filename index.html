					<h2>Who I am:</h2>
					<h3>I’m Spencer. I’m a full-stack developer with a need to succeed and an aptitude to aesthetics.</h3>
					<p>A recent graduate from Thinkful’s full stack flex program, I like to produce things, be it in wood, graphite on paper, or now in code and script. For me, building an app or site follows much the same process as creating a drawing or painting: start with an idea, put an outline on paper, flush out the details, and work like hell until it’s perfect.<br>

Beyond the screens and paper, I enjoy board games and table tops, hiking, and swimming, and soon I will be the father of twins. One of my greatest passions is zoology and conservation is deeply important to me. I dabble in guitar and I love the blues. Finailly, i am a bit of a cinephile and for a few years I watched a new movie every day.
